        <h1>Key Features of Aquafox</h1>
        <h2>Lightweight Design:</h2>
        <p>I'm constantly working on optimizing Aquafox by removing deprecated services and unnecessary bloat, in an attempt to make the browser as lightweight as possible.</p>
        <h2>FoxPEP Tweaks:</h2>
        <p>Aquafox inherits the majority of the enhancements from the FoxPEP project for improved performance and usability, with a few settings tweaked to provide a better out-of-the-box experience. But please, feel free to head over to about:config and make it your own.</p>
        <h2>InterWebPPC Changes:</h2>
        <p>Aquafox started as a continuation of InterWebPPC and incorporates most of the optimizations made by wicknix to the TenFourFox source code.</p>
        <h2>Security:</h2>
        <p>New releases with updated security components are issued quarterly, based on the current Firefox ESR release, to ensure compatibility with HTTPS websites.</p>
